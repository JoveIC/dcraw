Modified version of dcraw by Dave Coffin that handles Raspberry Pi raw files.

Original from http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

Modified to handle the JPEG+RAW files that can be generated by the
Raspberry Pi camera modules, or just the raw file with Broadcom
header passing data on raw format and resolution.

Original build instructions:
```
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev libjpeg8-dev gettext liblcms2-dev
./buildme
```

on Ubuntu 18.04
```
Unable to locate package libjasper-dev

```

Work-around
```
sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev gettext liblcms2-dev
gcc -o dcraw -O4 dcraw.c -lm -DNO_JPEG -DNO_LCMS -DNO_JASPER
```
